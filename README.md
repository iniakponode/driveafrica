This is the mobile app for the PhD project on Using AI Enabled Apps to encourage safe driving in Non-Western Countries-Nigeria in Context

## API Keys

The project expects API keys to be defined locally. Create a `local.properties` file
in the project root (this file is ignored by Git) and add:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
CHAT_GPT_API_KEY=your_chatgpt_key
```

Alternatively, you can export the environment variables `GEMINI_API_KEY` and
`CHAT_GPT_API_KEY` before running Gradle commands.
